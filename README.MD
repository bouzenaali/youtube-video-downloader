# YouTube Downloader

This is a simple Python script that allows you to download YouTube videos. The script uses the **pytube** library to interact with the YouTube API and download videos.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

To run this script, you'll need to have **Python 3** and the **pytube** and **tqdm** libraries installed. You can install these libraries using pip:
``` 
pip install pytube tqdm
```

### Usage

To use the script, run main.py with Python from the command line:
```
python main.py
```
The script will prompt you to enter the URL of the YouTube video you want to download. Once you enter the URL, the script will display a list of available resolutions for the video and prompt you to choose one. You can then enter the directory where you want to save the video.

The script will download the video with a progress bar to show the download progress. Once the download is complete, the script will display a success message.
